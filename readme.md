## Favorite Movies and Restaurants - (FMR)
# Developed by Audie Artavia

This is a small restfull API for a mongodb database using flask, it has been containerized using docker and nginx.
It is functional with a basic CRUD to users, movies and restaurante, more features will be implemented like:
 - Adding favorites of either movies or restaurants to the user profile
 - User's credentials validation
 - schema validation, although schema validator is used on mongo, it will also be implemented on the API.
